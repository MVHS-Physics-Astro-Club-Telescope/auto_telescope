# Pi Subsystem README

# Overview

The Pi subsystem runs on the Raspberry Pi and is responsible for direct hardware control. It executes commands received from the Host and translates them into motor movements, sensor reads, and physical actions.
This subsystem acts as the bridge between software and electronics.

# Responsibilities

The Pi subsystem handles:
    - Motor control (movement and focus)
    - Sensor data acquisition
    - Real-time hardware interaction
    - Executing commands from the Host
    - Sending feedback/state data back to the Host
